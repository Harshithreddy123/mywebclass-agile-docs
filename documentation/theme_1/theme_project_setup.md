Our objective is to establish a highly visible web presence using lean and agile principles to quickly and effectively
develop a strong foundation for our web project. By completing the initiatives outlined in this theme, we can establish a
solid foundation that ensures our web page meets our business requirements throughout the life of the project, setting
us up for long-term success.

## Theme
As a software developer, I want to improve the performance of our web application so that our users can have a faster and smoother experience. By conducting load testing and optimizing the code, we can enhance the scalability of our application. This will enable us to handle increased traffic and user load without any performance issues. By following agile development principles, we can quickly and effectively identify and address performance bottlenecks, leading to a more robust and reliable application. Our project deliverables include a detailed report on the results of load testing, as well as a set of recommendations and solutions for optimizing the application's performance. By implementing these improvements, we can set ourselves up for long-term benefit by providing a more enjoyable and satisfying user experience.
